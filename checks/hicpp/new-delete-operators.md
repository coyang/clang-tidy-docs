# hicpp-new-delete-operators

This check is an alias for
`misc-new-delete-overloads <../misc/new-delete-overloads>`{.interpreted-text
role="doc"}. Implements [rule
12.3.1](https://www.perforce.com/resources/qac/high-integrity-cpp-coding-standard/special-member-functions)
to ensure the [new]{.title-ref} and [delete]{.title-ref} operators have
the correct signature.
