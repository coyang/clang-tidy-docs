# fuchsia-statically-constructed-objects

Warns if global, non-trivial objects with static storage are
constructed, unless the object is statically initialized with a
`constexpr` constructor or has no explicit constructor.

For example:

```c++
class A {};

class B {
public:
  B(int Val) : Val(Val) {}
private:
  int Val;
};

class C {
public:
  constexpr C(int Val) : Val(Val) {}
  C(int Val1, int Val2) : Val(Val1+Val2) {}

private:
  int Val;
};

static A a;         // No warning, as there is no explicit constructor
static C c(0);      // No warning, as constructor is constexpr

static B b(0);      // Warning, as constructor is not constexpr
static C c2(0, 1);  // Warning, as constructor is not constexpr

static int i;       // No warning, as it is trivial

extern int get_i();
static C c3(get_i());// Warning, as the constructor is dynamically initialized
```
