# cppcoreguidelines-pro-type-static-cast-downcast

This check flags all usages of `static_cast`, where a base class is
casted to a derived class. In those cases, a fix-it is provided to
convert the cast to a `dynamic_cast`.

Use of these casts can violate type safety and cause the program to
access a variable that is actually of type `X` to be accessed as if it
were of an unrelated type `Z`.

This rule is part of the [Type safety
(Type.2)](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Pro-type-downcast)
profile from the C++ Core Guidelines.

## Options

::: option
StrictMode

When set to [false]{.title-ref}, no warnings are emitted for casts on
non-polymorphic types. Default is [true]{.title-ref}.
