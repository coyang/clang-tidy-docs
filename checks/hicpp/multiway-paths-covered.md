# hicpp-multiway-paths-covered

This check discovers situations where code paths are not fully-covered.
It furthermore suggests using `if` instead of `switch` if the code will
be more clear. The [rule
6.1.2](https://www.perforce.com/resources/qac/high-integrity-cpp-coding-standard/statements)
and [rule
6.1.4](https://www.perforce.com/resources/qac/high-integrity-cpp-coding-standard/statements)
of the High Integrity C++ Coding Standard are enforced.

`if-else if` chains that miss a final `else` branch might lead to
unexpected program execution and be the result of a logical error. If
the missing `else` branch is intended you can leave it empty with a
clarifying comment. This warning can be noisy on some code bases, so it
is disabled by default.

```c++
void f1() {
  int i = determineTheNumber();

   if(i > 0) {
     // Some Calculation
   } else if (i < 0) {
     // Precondition violated or something else.
   }
   // ...
}
```

Similar arguments hold for `switch` statements which do not cover all
possible code paths.

```c++
// The missing default branch might be a logical error. It can be kept empty
// if there is nothing to do, making it explicit.
void f2(int i) {
  switch (i) {
  case 0: // something
    break;
  case 1: // something else
    break;
  }
  // All other numbers?
}

// Violates this rule as well, but already emits a compiler warning (-Wswitch).
enum Color { Red, Green, Blue, Yellow };
void f3(enum Color c) {
  switch (c) {
  case Red: // We can't drive for now.
    break;
  case Green:  // We are allowed to drive.
    break;
  }
  // Other cases missing
}
```

The [rule
6.1.4](https://www.perforce.com/resources/qac/high-integrity-cpp-coding-standard/statements)
requires every `switch` statement to have at least two `case` labels
other than a [default]{.title-ref} label. Otherwise, the `switch` could
be better expressed with an `if` statement. Degenerated `switch`
statements without any labels are caught as well.

```c++
// Degenerated switch that could be better written as `if`
int i = 42;
switch(i) {
  case 1: // do something here
  default: // do something else here
}

// Should rather be the following:
if (i == 1) {
  // do something here
}
else {
  // do something here
}
```

```c++
// A completely degenerated switch will be diagnosed.
int i = 42;
switch(i) {}
```

## Options

::: option
WarnOnMissingElse

Boolean flag that activates a warning for missing `else` branches.
Default is [false]{.title-ref}.
