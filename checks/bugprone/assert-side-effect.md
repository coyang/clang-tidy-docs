# bugprone-assert-side-effect

Finds `assert()` with side effect.

The condition of `assert()` is evaluated only in debug builds so a
condition with side effect can cause different behavior in debug /
release builds.

## Options

::: option
AssertMacros

A comma-separated list of the names of assert macros to be checked.
Default is [assert,NSAssert,NSCAssert]{.title-ref}.
:::

::: option
CheckFunctionCalls

Whether to treat non-const member and non-member functions as they
produce side effects. Disabled by default because it can increase the
number of false positive warnings.
:::

::: option
IgnoredFunctions

A semicolon-separated list of the names of functions or methods to be
considered as not having side-effects. Regular expressions are accepted,
e.g. `[Rr]ef(erence)?$` matches every type with suffix `Ref`, `ref`,
`Reference` and `reference`. The default is empty. If a name in the list
contains the sequence [::]{.title-ref} it is matched against the
qualified type name (i.e. `namespace::Type`), otherwise it is matched
against only the type name (i.e. `Type`).
