# readability-redundant-inline-specifier

Detects redundant `inline` specifiers on function and variable
declarations.

Examples:

```c++
constexpr inline void f() {}
```

In the example above the keyword `inline` is redundant since constexpr
functions are implicitly inlined

```c++
class MyClass {
    inline void myMethod() {}
};
```

In the example above the keyword `inline` is redundant since member
functions defined entirely inside a class/struct/union definition are
implicitly inlined.

## Options

::: option
StrictMode

If set to [true]{.title-ref}, the check will also flag functions and
variables that already have internal linkage as redundant. Default is
[false]{.title-ref}.
