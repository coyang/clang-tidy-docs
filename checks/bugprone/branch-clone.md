# bugprone-branch-clone

Checks for repeated branches in `if/else if/else` chains, consecutive
repeated branches in `switch` statements and identical true and false
branches in conditional operators.

```c++
if (test_value(x)) {
  y++;
  do_something(x, y);
} else {
  y++;
  do_something(x, y);
}
```

In this simple example (which could arise e.g. as a copy-paste error)
the `then` and `else` branches are identical and the code is equivalent
the following shorter and cleaner code:

```c++
test_value(x); // can be omitted unless it has side effects
y++;
do_something(x, y);
```

If this is the intended behavior, then there is no reason to use a
conditional statement; otherwise the issue can be solved by fixing the
branch that is handled incorrectly.

The check detects repeated branches in longer `if/else if/else` chains
where it would be even harder to notice the problem.

The check also detects repeated inner and outer `if` statements that may
be a result of a copy-paste error. This check cannot currently detect
identical inner and outer `if` statements if code is between the `if`
conditions. An example is as follows.

```c++
void test_warn_inner_if_1(int x) {
  if (x == 1) {    // warns, if with identical inner if
    if (x == 1)    // inner if is here
      ;
  if (x == 1) {    // does not warn, cannot detect
    int y = x;
    if (x == 1)
      ;
  }
}
```

In `switch` statements the check only reports repeated branches when
they are consecutive, because it is relatively common that the `case:`
labels have some natural ordering and rearranging them would decrease
the readability of the code. For example:

```c++
switch (ch) {
case 'a':
  return 10;
case 'A':
  return 10;
case 'b':
  return 11;
case 'B':
  return 11;
default:
  return 10;
}
```

Here the check reports that the `'a'` and `'A'` branches are identical
(and that the `'b'` and `'B'` branches are also identical), but does not
report that the `default:` branch is also identical to the first two
branches. If this is indeed the correct behavior, then it could be
implemented as:

```c++
switch (ch) {
case 'a':
case 'A':
  return 10;
case 'b':
case 'B':
  return 11;
default:
  return 10;
}
```

Here the check does not warn for the repeated `return 10;`, which is
good if we want to preserve that `'a'` is before `'b'` and `default:` is
the last branch.

Switch cases marked with the `[[fallthrough]]` attribute are ignored.

Finally, the check also examines conditional operators and reports code
like:

```c++
return test_value(x) ? x : x;
```

Unlike if statements, the check does not detect chains of conditional
operators.

Note: This check also reports situations where branches become identical
only after preprocessing.
