# bugprone-macro-parentheses

Finds macros that can have unexpected behavior due to missing
parentheses.

Macros are expanded by the preprocessor as-is. As a result, there can be
unexpected behavior; operators may be evaluated in unexpected order and
unary operators may become binary operators, etc.

When the replacement list has an expression, it is recommended to
surround it with parentheses. This ensures that the macro result is
evaluated completely before it is used.

It is also recommended to surround macro arguments in the replacement
list with parentheses. This ensures that the argument value is
calculated properly.

This check corresponds to the CERT C Coding Standard rule [PRE20-C.
Macro replacement lists should be
parenthesized.](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/PRE02-C.+Macro+replacement+lists+should+be+parenthesized)
